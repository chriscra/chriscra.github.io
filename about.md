# About me

I am currently a AAAS [Science & Technology Policy Fellow](https://www.aaas.org/programs/science-technology-policy-fellowships) placed in the USDA [Office of the Chief Scientist](https://www.usda.gov/our-agency/staff-offices/office-chief-scientist-ocs).
Prior to my fellowship, I completed a short postdoc in the [Center for Policy Research on Energy and the Environment](https://cpree.princeton.edu/) in Princeton University's [School of Public and International Affairs](https://spia.princeton.edu) with [Professor David S. Wilcove](https://dwilcove.scholar.princeton.edu/meet-team).
In May 2022, I defended my dissertation in environmental policy, titled ["*Agriculture in flux, biodiversity in the balance: conservation implications of agricultural expansion and abandonment*"](https://dataspace.princeton.edu/handle/88435/dsp0141687m68v), also advised by [Professor Wilcove](https://dwilcove.scholar.princeton.edu/meet-team).

Prior to graduate school, I worked at the environmental nonprofit [Sustainable Conservation](https://suscon.org/) in San Francisco, working to encourage river restoration in Californiaâ€™s Central Valley and prevent the use of invasive plants in gardening and landscaping through the [PlantRight](https://plantright.org/) program.
A proud Michigander, I grew up in East Lansing, MI and graduated from the [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/) with a degree in ecology & evolutionary biology in 2012.
I now live in Arlington, VA with my wife, daughter, and dog.
In my free time, I enjoy baking sourdough, looking for birds, listening to Swedish music, and taking photos of clouds.
