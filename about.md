# About me

I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate in Princeton University's [School of Public and International Affairs](https://spia.princeton.edu), housed in the [Center for Policy Research on Energy and the Environment](https://cpree.princeton.edu/).
In May 2022, I defended my dissertation in environmental policy, titled "*Agriculture in flux, biodiversity in the balance: conservation implications of agricultural expansion and abandonment*" ([see here](https://dataspace.princeton.edu/handle/88435/dsp0141687m68v)), advised by [Professor David S. Wilcove](https://dwilcove.scholar.princeton.edu/meet-team).

Prior to graduate school, I worked at the environmental nonprofit [Sustainable Conservation](https://suscon.org/) in San Francisco, working to encourage river restoration in Californiaâ€™s Central Valley and prevent the use of invasive plants in gardening and landscaping through the [PlantRight](https://plantright.org/) program.
A proud Michigander, I grew up in East Lansing, MI and graduated from the [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/) in 2012.
In my free time, I enjoy baking sourdough, looking for birds, listening to Swedish music, and taking pictures of clouds.
