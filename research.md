As a conservation scientist, I use the tools of geospatial analysis, ecology, and environmental science to investigate what a changing agricultural footprint means for the natural world.
I've been fascinated with biodiversity - the diversity of life at all scales, whether genetic, between species, or among ecosystems - from a young age, and am driven to protect the natural world for both intrinsic ("wow, cool!") and utilitarian reasons (ecosystem services like carbon storage, crop pollination, and flood protection).
To a large degree, the fate of the natural world depends on how we humans go about feeding ourselves.
We already collectively use nearly 40% of the earth's ice-free land for agriculture, and agriculturally-driven habitat loss remains the largest threat to species, even while climate change and overexploitation make things even more uncomfortable for wildlife.

Yet agriculture’s footprint is currently in a state of flux, with some places experiencing agricultural **expansion and intensification** to meeting rising demands while others experience **abandonment** as people move and the economics of farming change due to demographic, technological, and environmental changes.
I’m motivated by a desire to find opportunities to conserve biodiversity throughout these agricultural transitions, whether that means helping guide expansion in order to minimize impact or fostering a return of nature following abandonment.

My research has focused on questions related to the environmental trade-offs these transitions present:  
- Where does cropland abandonment occur and to what extent is it durable?
- Where will these transitions present opportunities for habitat regeneration in former croplands, and how might policies be designed to harness these opportunities and encourage regeneration?
- In places where agricultural expansion is necessary, can spatial land-use prioritization tools help minimize biodiversity loss?

Read on for more details on some of my most recent projects.

# Quantifying the environmental consequences of recent cropland abandonment

Though agriculture continues to expand in many places, tens of millions of hectares of croplands have been abandoned across the world in recent decades as people in rural areas moved into cities in pursuit of better economic opportunities, and agriculture has been reshaped by environmental, economic, and sociopolitical upheaval.
Abandonment is likely to continue for many years due to broad economic and demographic changes, presenting a substantial sources of land that could be used for land-based climate mitigation or ecosystem restoration without imposing significant opportunity costs.
Could this create opportunities to restore ecosystems while storing carbon and recovering wildlife in the process?

## Tracking the persistence of recent cropland abandonment to understand its implications for biodiversity and carbon sequestration

Historically, it has been really difficult to track agricultural abandonment through time at meaningful scales, limiting our ability to answer questions about what abandonment is likely to mean for the environment.
However, recent advances in remote sensing have made it possible to track abandonment across broad areas, and my excellent collaborators He Yin (Professor at Kent State University) and Volker Radeloff (University of Wisconsin-Madison) leveraged imagery from the NASA Landsat program to produce a cutting-edge land cover time-series.
Using this time-series, we were able to track the outcomes of abandonment at 11 sites covering four continents and a range of different biomes. 
early 40% of all croplands cross our sites were abandoned at least once between 1987-2017. 
But abandonment was dynamic, & 31% of these abandoned croplands were recultivated before the end of the time series.
This means less area for new wildlife habitat & less carbon sequestered as ecosystems regenerate.
These abandoned croplands accumulated 110 million tons of carbon by 2017, yet this was 35% less that what could have accumulated if no recultivation had occurred.
Given that abandonment is a dynamic process, with various croplands going in & out of cultivation at different times over the course of the time series, we developed linear models to predict how long abandoned croplands would be abandoned as a function of time.
At most sites, we predict that >50% of abandoned croplands will be recultivated within 30 years. 
For many ecosystems, it can take >50 years to recover the species communities & carbon levels of similar intact ecosystems.

So, the short answer is yes, but *only* if these croplands are given enough time to recover. 
Without incentives for restoration, cropland abandonment rarely lasts long enough to yield biodiversity or carbon benefits.
