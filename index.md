I am a conservation scientist using the tools of geospatial analysis, ecology, and environmental science to tackle the defining conservation challenge of our time: reconciling agricultural land use with biodiversity conservation. 
My work examines how changes in the distribution of people and agriculture affect biodiversity and carbon storage, with a focus on the environmental implications of agricultural abandonment â€“ all aiming to use science to inform land use policy and better conserve wildlife and wild places.
