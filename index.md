I am a conservation scientist using the tools of geospatial analysis, ecology, and environmental science to tackle the defining conservation challenge of our time: reconciling agriculture with biodiversity conservation. 
My past work examined how changes in the distribution of people and agriculture affect biodiversity and carbon storage, with a focus on the environmental implications of agricultural abandonment.
As a AAAS Science & Technology Policy Fellow at the USDA, I'm now combining my interdisciplinary expertise and technical skills with my experience translating across disciplines and building collaborations to inform agricultural science-policy.
Over the course of my career, I aim to use science to inform agricultural and land use policy in order to better conserve wildlife and wild places.
